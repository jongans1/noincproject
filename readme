Hello - this is a quick description of how I went about this.  I wanted to do it serverless if possible, so I thought about using
Lambda, but it would require me rewriting some of the Node code.  The other route I thought of, was to put the app in a 
Docker container, and then use ECS to run it in a load balanced set of EC2 containers.  Ultimately I used Fargate because it is
serverless, rather than using ECS with EC2's.

I have included my Dockerfile, and the Docker-entrypoint.sh

Here is the URL where the app is running:

Thanks for the opportunity.
